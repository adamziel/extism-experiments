## Extism explorations

This is a fun experimental repo where I poke around with what [Extism](https://extism.org/) and what are its limitations in a web browser.

To play around, install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and run:

```shell
npm install dev
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Yes, `:3000`. I know the terminal says `:8000` but please go to `:3000`.
